### Week 1 (Date:   )
    - Ben, worked through literary readings to get a better understanding of the topic as well as current research going on in the field. Met with my project partner Ranjot over the weekend to discuss a rough plan as well as our personal goals and skills that could help us better understand each others strengths well working through this research term to best complete our goals. Finished reading 3 papers that were all focused on the idea off forecasting EV infrastructure in cities as well as research into charging techniques for EVs as well as the demand charging can put on the vehicle as well as the power grid. Ranjot and I ensured we read different papers to be able to communicate with one another and findings that would be important to our research and most effectively manage our time. All weekly meetings were attended, EV team meeting as well as our Friday group meeting.
