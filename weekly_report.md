## Weekly Report
- This file contains a paragraph of 1000 Characters or more about the progress made by the student for each week. I am creating the place holder for it.

### Week 1 (Date:   )
    - Ben, worked through literary readings to get a better understanding of the topic as well as current research going on in the field. Met with my project partner Ranjot over the weekend to discuss a rough plan as well as our personal goals and skills that could help us better understand each others strengths well working through this research term to best complete our goals. Finished reading 3 papers that were all focused on the idea off forecasting EV infrastructure in cities as well as research into charging techniques for EVs as well as the demand charging can put on the vehicle as well as the power grid. Ranjot and I ensured we read different papers to be able to communicate with one another and findings that would be important to our research and most effectively manage our time. All weekly meetings were attended, EV team meeting as well as our Friday group meeting.

### Week 2 (Date:   )
    - Ben, Continued with some literature review, read a paper based on EV infastructre forcasting in a large EV filled city in China. The paper really showed how much infastructure demands can change based on how aggressive a city or country chooses to adopt EV vehicles. Started to remind myself of how to write SQL code and find the proper tools I would need to work on the data and get it into a Postgres data type to allow for us to continue to work on it using various tables and views. Continued to meet regulary with Ranjot through out the week and discuss each others findings as well as thoughts when it comes to our research. All meetings through out the week were atteneded including the EV team meeting and research team meeting.

### Week 3 (Date:   )
    - Ben, Started work on the SQL database importing data on EV vehicle adoption statistics as well as building data for Onatrio, I am working in pgAdmin 4 for the SQL side of things and for the data on the buildings I had to install and learn the basics of how to use QGRIS to allow me to export the data from geographical data into my postgres DB to allow me to create tables and views with all of the data. Made good progress with tables and views on EV Adoption, Population data and having some issues organizing building data due to missing or empty data fields as well as having such a large amount of data involved. All weekly meetings were attended, EV team meeting as well as reseach team meeting. 

### Week 4 (Date:   )
    - Ben, Continued to work on the postrgres database adding more views and tables as needed. Spent most of my time trying to clean up as much data as possible to avoid missing or empty data. Continued to have issues of efficiently importing, cleaning and organizing data in a timely manner to advance the research project. Raised my concerns in the EV team meeting and we decided to pivot to a smaller scale database to begin with by manually collecting data on buidlings such as, Building name, postal code, # of units, # of floors and then calculating the EV adoption rate for the area the building is in based off of the FSA (First three digits of postal code) and the population of the FSA. Continued discussions with Ranjot and Durhm to make sure everyone understood our new goal and could get started right away.

### Week 5 (Date:   )
    - Ben, Collected the data mentioned previously for a total of 32 buildings, now the only critical step remaining is to define how we want to estimate the population of a given building based on number of units and average SQFT in Onatrio. Well researching all the building I also looked into parking data for most of the buildings I was looking into and discovered most parkinmg for buildings is not public information for how many spaces are available or how many chargers are already installed. most buildings had no information public at all with some having spot breakdowns. Progress should be able to made very soon once all data is defined on the software side of the things and we should be able to  actually run some kind of algorithm using the dataset of buildings to predict first the number of EV vehicles and then how many chargers would be needed as well as cost of setup and ROI information.

### Week 6 (Date:   )
